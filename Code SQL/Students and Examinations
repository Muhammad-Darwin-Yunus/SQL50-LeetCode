Return the result table ordered by student_id and subject_name.

Data Students:
student_id: int
student_name: varchar

Data Subjects:
subject_name: varchar

>.<

Solution:

select s.student_id,s.student_name,sub.subject_name,count(e.subject_name) as attended_exams
from Students s
cross join Subjects sub
left join Examinations e on s.student_id = e.student_id and sub.subject_name = e.subject_name
group by s.student_id,s.student_name,sub.subject_name
order by s.student_id,sub.subject_name;

Output:

| student_id | student_name | subject_name | attended_exams |
| ---------- | ------------ | ------------ | -------------- |
| 1          | Alice        | Math         | 3              |
| 1          | Alice        | Physics      | 2              |
| 1          | Alice        | Programming  | 1              |
| 2          | Bob          | Math         | 1              |
| 2          | Bob          | Physics      | 0              |
| 2          | Bob          | Programming  | 1              |
