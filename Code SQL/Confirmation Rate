Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/confirmation-rate/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50
Level: Medium

The confirmation rate of a user is the number of 'confirmed' messages divided by the total number of requested confirmation messages.
The confirmation rate of a user that did not request any confirmation messages is 0.
Round the confirmation rate to two decimal places.
Write a solution to find the confirmation rate of each user.

Data Signups:
user_id: int
time_stamp: datetime

Data Confirmations:
user_id: int
time_stamp: datetime
action: ENUM

>.<

Solution:

select s.user_id,round(ifnull(avg(c.action = 'confirmed'),0),2) confirmation_rate
from Signups s
left join Confirmations c on s.user_id = c.user_id
group by s.user_id;

Output:

| user_id | confirmation_rate |
| ------- | ----------------- |
| 3       | 0                 |
| 7       | 1                 |
| 2       | 0.5               |
| 6       | 0                 |
